This is a file from the fork clytwynec/meta-stuff, created on the master branch.

PR to be made:
clytwynec/meta-stuff:master --> benpatterson/meta-stuff:master

Expected CI behavior:
1 build to run when PR is opened (on clytwynec/meta-stuff:master)
1 build to run once PR is merged (on benpatterson/meta-stuff:master)

Now test this
